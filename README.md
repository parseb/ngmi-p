WAGMI of course, no doubt about it. At the cutting edge of technological achievement and socio-political possibility people tend to be full of hope, some insomuch that they genuinely adopt an unflinching belief that their own immortality is just around the corner. That is a possibility. Probability however cannot ignore that "since the beginning of time" there is little to show as to sustain the thesis that anyone has so far made it.
